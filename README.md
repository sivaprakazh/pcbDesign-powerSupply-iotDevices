# PCB DESIGN ON POWER SUPPLY FOR IOT PORTABLE DEVICES

  This is the production ready pcb file for power supply iot devices. And this module perfect foe 3.7V, 1A devices.
Moudule based on the TP4056 charger IC and DW01 Deep Drain Battery Protection IC. And the battery voltage drops is below 2.4V the protection IC will switch the load off to protect the cell, and running at too low of a voltage â€“also protects against over-voltage and reverse polarity 

## Features
    Under Voltage Cut off / Deep Drain Protection
    Over Current Protection
    Adjustable Current Limit through R-Prog
    Over-voltage charging protection
    Usb Micro Connector (with more commonly available usb cables)
    LED Status Indicator for Charging / Full charge status monitoring
